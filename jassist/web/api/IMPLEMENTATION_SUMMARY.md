# API Implementation Summary

## Core Infrastructure

We've successfully implemented the core API infrastructure for the Google Drive download and transcription services with the following components:

### 1. API App Structure
- Created a dedicated API app with proper organization
- Set up versioning (v1) for future compatibility
- Directory structure follows best practices for maintainability

### 2. Core Components
- **Responses**: Standardized response format for consistent API behavior
- **Exceptions**: Custom exception handling for better error reporting
- **Serializers**: Base serializer classes for data transformation
- **Permissions**: Permission classes for access control
- **Pagination**: Pagination utilities for handling large result sets
- **Views**: Base view classes with standardized response handling

### 3. API Endpoints
- Health check endpoint for API status verification
- User endpoint for retrieving current user information
- Google Drive configuration endpoints (placeholder implementation)
- Transcription job endpoints (placeholder implementation)

### 4. Configuration
- Django REST Framework integrated into Django settings
- URL routing for API endpoints
- Logging configuration for API operations

### 5. Documentation
- API README with endpoint documentation
- Example client for API usage demonstration

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to Real Data**: 
   - Implement the actual models and business logic for each endpoint
   - Connect placeholder endpoints to database models

2. **Authentication Enhancement**:
   - Implement token-based authentication for better API security
   - Add API key support for third-party integration

3. **Testing**:
   - Create test cases for each endpoint
   - Implement unit and integration tests

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Implement filtering and searching
   - Add caching for improved performance
   - Rate limiting for API abuse prevention

5. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
   - Improve example code and usage guides
